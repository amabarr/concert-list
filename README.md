# Concerts list

All the concerts I've been to in my life!

Brought to you by Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, and React.js

This is currently a work in progress.

To run this:

- Pull this repo down
- Seed concert data locally via: `bundle exec rails r script/concert_and_artist_seed.rb`
- `yarn build` to generate the frontend
- Run the repo via `bin/rails server`
- Go to `localhost:3000/` and see all of the concerts/artists I've seen!
